De Ursis was a pioneer Chinese medical missionary in Gansu and belonged to the early Jesuits in the China mission [[2]](http://bdcconline.net/en/stories/de-ursis-sabbatino) [[3]](https://monicazhao.scienceblog.com/17/were-christian-missionaries-a-modernizing-force-during-the-late-qing-dynasty/).<br /><br />3. **P.
