﻿Translate it into Chinese: CHEN-Vo眞可(T.達觀，H.紫柏)，July 2, 1544-January 18, 1604, Buddhist monk and poet, was a native of Wu-chiang 吳江, south of Soochow, where he was born into the Shen 沈 family. It is said that even at the age of four Chemk'o could not speak. One day a strange monk came to the Shen family, laid his hand upon the child's head, and told the father that the boy would become a teacher of both mundane and heavenly things if he would enter the monastery. Then the monk disappeared, and Chen-k'o began to speak. During his boyhood he showed an unusual strength of will and character; he did not enjoy playing with other children and when he grew older he took a dislike to the sight of women. He never allowed a female to enter the bath before him and when one day his elder sister inadvertently came there, he made such a scene that afterwards no female member of the house dared to come near him at this time.<break>At the age of sixteen (1560) he took his sword, left the house, and wandered north to the Great Wall. On his way back<break>he was stopped by rain at Soochow, where he met a monk, Ming-chiieh 明覺，who gave him shelter at Hu-ch'iu (Tiger Hill), ssu 虎丘寺.During the night he listened to Ming-chiieh reciting the 88 names of the Buddha; this impressed him so much that the next morning he asked to have his head shaven and be admitted as the latter's disciple. After some time Chen-k'o locked himself up in his cell, studied for six months, and was at last formally ordained at the age of nineteen (1563).
